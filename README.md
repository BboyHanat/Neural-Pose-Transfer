# Neural-Pose-Transfer

This is an implementation of the CVPR'20 paper "Neural Pose Transfer by Spatially Adaptive Instance Normalization".

## Dependencies

Requirements:
- python3.6
- numpy
- pytorch==1.1.0
- [pymesh](https://pymesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Our code has been tested with Python 3.6, Pytorch1.1.0, CUDA 9.0 on Ubuntu 16.04.

## Training
We provide both original and max-pooling methods. The original method has slightly better quantitative results. The max-pooling method is more convenient when dealing with identity and pose meshes with different number of vertices and this method produces smoother results.

python train.py
